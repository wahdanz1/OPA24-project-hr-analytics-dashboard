## Project Description
### Purpose
The project aims to implement the modern data stack to solve a real-world problem. In addition to using a certain number of techniques, there is a focus on working together in a data team. This includes both agile development and being able to use Git and GitHub in a team

### Scenario
Imagine you are a data engineer for a HR agency. Here's an overview of the business model of this agency:
<br>
Talent acquisition specialists work with different occupation fields. According to the opening job ads on Arbetsförmedlingen, they will:
- search and contact potential candidates from LinkedIn
- contact and market those potential candidates to corresponding employers
<br>
Therefore, they constantly analyze job ads in order to understand which types of candidates they should approach. Currently, every begining of the week, they manually browse the homepage of Arbetsförmedlingen and download a list of opening job ads to guide their work over the week. However, they are not able to draw insights from these job ads as:
- the information is messy
- they have spent too much time to manually collect and clean data so that they do not have much time to analyze the data, which is important to improve the efficiency of their work
<br>
Now, you are given a task to create a data pipeline for the team of talent acquisition specialists to:
- automate the data extraction from Jobtech API of Arbetsförmedlingen
- transform and structure data according to a dimensional model
- design a dashboard for talent acquisition specialists to analyse numbers of vacancies by city, by occupation and by employment types etc, for each of the occupation fields
- etc... details of all requirements will be described in the tasks below
